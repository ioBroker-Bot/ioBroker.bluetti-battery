## bluetti-battery adapter for ioBroker

Monitor and control Bluetti power stations / batteries over Bluetooth Low Energy
(MODBUS-over-BLE). This is a Node.js/TypeScript port of the protocol from
[bluetti_mqtt](https://github.com/warhammerkid/bluetti_mqtt), integrated directly
into ioBroker so no extra Python service or MQTT broker is required.

### Supported devices

One adapter instance talks to one device.

| Status | Devices |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Confirmed on real hardware | `AC300`, `AC500` (incl. pack polling and controls) |
| ⚙️ Ported, needs a tester | `AC200M`, `AC200L`, `AC240`, `AC60`, `EP500`, `EP500P`, `EP600`, `EB3A` |
| 🧪 Experimental (fork maps / unverified) | `AC180`, `AC2A`, `AC70`, `V2` (encrypted) |

If your device is in the "needs a tester" or "experimental" row, please report
how it behaves — see [Testing & reporting](#testing--reporting).

### Testing & reporting

This adapter is young and most device profiles have not been verified on real
hardware. Reports are very welcome. Please open a
[Device report](../../issues/new?template=device_report.yml) issue with:

- your device model and the log line `Using device profile: ...`,
- which values/controls are correct, and which are wrong or missing,
- for wrong values, the value the adapter shows **and** the value in the Bluetti
  app (so scaling can be checked),
- debug-level logs (especially `MODBUS exception` / `rejected` warnings, and the
  handshake lines for encrypted `V2` devices).

### Encrypted (v2) devices

Newer Bluetti units use an encrypted BLE handshake (AES-CBC + ECDH). Select the
`V2` device type, or set **Encryption** to `on`, to enable it. This support is a
port of the [nhurman fork](https://github.com/nhurman/bluetti_mqtt) and is
**experimental**: the crypto primitives are unit-tested, but the full handshake
has not been verified against real hardware. Feedback welcome.

### Requirements

- Linux host with **BlueZ** (the standard Linux Bluetooth stack). The adapter
  uses [`node-ble`](https://github.com/chrvadala/node-ble), which talks to BlueZ
  over D-Bus — it does **not** grab the HCI adapter exclusively, so it coexists
  with other BLE adapters and the system Bluetooth stack.
- The user running ioBroker needs D-Bus permission to use BlueZ. If you get
  permission errors, add a D-Bus policy for the `iobroker` user (see the
  [node-ble setup notes](https://github.com/chrvadala/node-ble#provide-permissions)).

### Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| MAC address | Bluetooth MAC of the device, e.g. `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`. |
| Device type | `auto` detects from the advertised BLE name, or pick the model manually. |
| Polling interval | Seconds between reads (default 10). |
| Poll per-pack data | Also read per-pack cell voltages etc. (slower). |

States that map to writable MODBUS registers (e.g. `ac_output_on`,
`dc_output_on`, `ups_mode`) are created with write access; setting them sends a
`WriteSingleRegister` command to the device.

### Finding undocumented registers / controls

Some app settings (e.g. the AC charge-current limit) are newer than the
register maps. The adapter exposes raw MODBUS access via `sendTo` so you can
discover them the same way the original `bluetti-discovery` tool does: dump a
register range, change the setting in the Bluetti app, dump again, and diff.

From the JavaScript adapter / a script (replace `0` with your instance):

```js
// Read specific registers
sendTo('bluetti-battery.0', 'readRegisters', { address: 3019, quantity: 1 }, console.log);

// Scan a range (readable registers only)
sendTo('bluetti-battery.0', 'scanRange', { start: 3000, end: 3120 }, console.log);

// Write a register to test a control (use with care)
sendTo('bluetti-battery.0', 'writeRegister', { address: 3019, value: 10 }, console.log);
```

Workflow to find a setting: `scanRange` the likely control area (around
`2200–2260` and `3000–3120` on AC/EP devices), note the values, change the
setting in the app, `scanRange` again, and look for the register whose value
matches the new setting. Then `writeRegister` to confirm it controls the
setting before it gets a named state.
